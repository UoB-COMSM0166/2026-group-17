## Game Reseach

| Game | Gameplay reference | Features | Comments |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Pocket Tanks | [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nUg8DGOAF4) |<ul><li>Turn-based artillery combat</li><li>Destructible terrain</li><li>Template-based procedural terrain generation</li><li>2D physics simulation (arc trajectories, wind effects, bounces, and explosions)</li><li>Varied arsenal allowing for tactical gameplay</li></ul>| The core idea seems relatively basic which should allow for extra features to be added in a modular way. Depending on how difficult the implementation of the chosen main twist is, it shouldn’t be difficult to get to a minimum viable product and then keep feature creep in check. |
| Super Pang | [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKdwXu_XW9k) |<ul><li>Bubble-popping harpoon mechanics</li><li>Destructible and non-destructible obstacles and ladders make gameplay more varied</li><li>Bubbles come in different shapes and sizes</li><li>Destructible blocks have a chance to drop various power-ups</li><li>Creatures appearing in certain levels can temporarily prevent the player from shooting, give power-ups or pop bubbles</li></ul>| Accessible base game to build from. As there are only 2 types of bubbles based on their movements, there is scope for a number of extra different types to be added. Levels would probably better be handcrafted as procedural generation could potentially lead to incompletable levels depending on the chosen twist to the base game. Art for the backgrounds of stages could be time-consuming depending on the methods used for its creation. |
| Gruntz | [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdsGWyWakTQ) |<ul><li>Puzzle-strategy game with RTS-style controls</li><li>Equippable tools that can be used both for solving puzzles and fighting enemy grunts</li><li>Toy items used to distract enemy grunts</li><li>Quest mode (get to the end by solving puzzles on the way) and battle mode (defeat other players by getting a grunt into their fort)</li></ul>| Interesting idea to use as a base though developing the puzzles for each level could cost a significant amount of time. Coupled with the varied set of objects required to make the final product interesting, it could be challenging to get to a presentable core version of the idea, let alone add extra features. |
| Rush Hour | [game link](https://rushhourgame.thinkfun.com/) |<ul><li>Grid-based puzzle game focused on logical problem-solving</li><li>Discrete, turn-based vehicle movement with strict occupancy rules</li><li>Each level is designed with a finite state space and a single optimal solution</li></ul>| Puzzle solving game avoid the complex physics problem, however, it may also reduce the gameplay variety and the technically challenging. The game can be extended by introducing multiple target vehicles with different exits and vehicles with distinct functional abilities. In addition, player solutions can be evaluated against the optimal solution length, enabling efficiency-based scoring and analytical comparison of player performance. |
| Taxi Simulator  | [game link](https://classicreload.com/play/taxi-simulator.html) |<ul><li>City Navigation： a city map with roads, intersections, and traffic signals, requiring players to plan routes and make navigation decisions.</li><li>Traffic Rules and Hazards ： Players must avoid collisions and respond to traffic conditions, which affects performance and success.</li><li>Driving Control：Players control speed and direction, balancing careful driving with the need to reach destinations quickly.</li></ul>| I think this game has potential for extension by introducing different modes and scenarios.For example, a racing mode could focus only on speed and whether the player reaches the finish line. A money-making mode could evaluate performance based on the number of passengers served and bonus items collected. In addition, a multiplayer mode could allow two players to compete, either by racing to destinations or by comparing how much money they earn within a limited time. The problem is that this game is a 3D game, which is hader to create |
| THE DARKENING 2 (Doom2 mod) | [game link](https://classicreload.com/doom2-the-darkening-2.html) |<ul><li>Action-Focused FPS Gameplay：Players move through levels from a first-person perspective, shooting enemies and navigating hazards.</li><li>Multiple Single-Player Levels：The game includes 12 unique single-player maps with varied layouts and challenges.</li><li>In addition to solo play, 12 deathmatch maps are provided for competitive multiplayer combat</li></ul>| I think one aspect of this game that is worth learning from is how the game introduction page presents its information.  It explicitly includes the story, a complete list of levels, detailed information about different enemy types, available game modes, author information, and known bugs. This structured presentation can be applied to our own level design and game documentation. |
| Cutthroat Island  | [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCUABjIfCY) |<ul><li>Movie-based Action Platformer：The game is based on a adventure film, placing players in the role of treasure hunters seeking pieces of a map to find hidden treasure.</li><li>Playable Characters：Players can choose between two protagonists.</li><li>Collectable Weapons & Items：Players can pick up secondary weapons like knives, bombs, pistols, and torches, as well as useful items that affect health or progression.</li></ul>| One interesting aspect of this game is that it already has an established story background, and the levels and boss characters can be designed to correspond directly to events and characters from the movie. Another strength of the game is the variety of maps and environments. Despite being a 2D game, it offers diverse scenes and settings, which helps keep the gameplay engaging. |
| Temple Run |  [video link](http://youtube.com/watch?v=TuGv1WIyUK4&feature=youtu.be) |<ul><li>Endless runner gameplay where the player automatically runs forward and the game ends when hitting an obstacle or falling off the path.</li><li>Simple player controls including jumping, sliding, and turning to avoid obstacles.</li><li>Increasing game speed and difficulty over time.</li></ul>| This game may require significant art resources, so a simplified visual style could be used. An innovative feature could be adaptive difficulty, where obstacle frequency changes based on player performance. This would be technically feasible and could improve player engagement and accessibility. |
| Mega Man X | [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzVXlUoLU78) |<ul><li>Action-platformer game that combines jumping and shooting.</li><li>Players can jump on walls and dash to move faster and reach higher areas.</li><li>Boss fights where players gain new abilities after defeating them.</li></ul>| This game is a good reference for a platformer project, as the core mechanics are simple and feasible to implement. A possible innovation is to change the scene colors or music based on the player’s movement speed, which could make the game more interactive and immersive. This feature would be technically easy to implement and would add an interesting interaction between the player and the environment. |
